# AI System for Research Document Originality Verification

## Description
The AI System for Research Document Originality Verification is designed to detect plagiarism and ensure the originality of research documents. It leverages NLP techniques, TF-IDF, and Sentence-BERT to compare uploaded research documents against a database of stored papers. This system provides a similarity score, highlights plagiarized sections, and generates a detailed plagiarism report.

## About
Traditional plagiarism detection methods often rely on keyword matching and lack contextual understanding. This project enhances research integrity by using advanced AI-based similarity detection techniques, offering a more accurate and efficient way to verify originality. It includes:
- Secure file upload and storage in MongoDB.
- Text extraction from PDFs using PyMuPDF.
- Plagiarism detection using TF-IDF and SBERT.
- A user-friendly web interface built with React.js.
- Report generation with highlighted plagiarized sections.

## Features
- **Fast and Accurate Plagiarism Detection:** Uses NLP-based similarity detection.
- **Secure File Handling:** Supports large PDF files with GridFS.
- **Scalability:** Designed for handling large datasets efficiently.
- **Detailed Reports:** Generates reports highlighting plagiarized sections.
- **User-Friendly UI:** Easy-to-use React.js interface for uploading and checking documents.

## Requirements
- **Operating System:** Windows 10/Ubuntu (64-bit recommended)
- **Backend:** FastAPI, MongoDB (with GridFS for large file storage)
- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Libraries:**
  - `fastapi`
  - `pymupdf`
  - `pymongo`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `sentence-transformers`
  - `opencv-python`
  - `diff-match-patch`

### 1. File Upload
```http
POST /upload/
```
- Uploads a research document (PDF) and extracts text.
- Stores file details in MongoDB.

### 2. Plagiarism Check
```http
POST /check-plagiarism/
```
- Compares uploaded document with stored documents.
- Returns similarity scores and highlights plagiarized content.

### 3. Retrieve Reports
```http
GET /report/{file_id}
```
- Retrieves the plagiarism report for a given document.

## Output
#### Sample Plagiarism Report
